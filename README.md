<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
QueenBee, a web progessive app built to cope with the current pandemic. As you know there has been a lot of confusion due to Covid19, some services/hospitals are specialised for covid whereas others are not, I wanted to build a solution to this problem, so QueenBee was created, it is a portal where from all across the world can find hospitals/doctors near them with a single click, talk to other people regarding their problems or anything, if they do not want to visit a doctor or a hosptial they can simply use QueenBee to diagnose what their disease is and get a home remedy or a cure, if the situation is serious it will automatically tell us to visit a doctor, all with a single click!, at last but not the least you can share information, start a blog and see fun posts related to health or anything that people wish to share!
